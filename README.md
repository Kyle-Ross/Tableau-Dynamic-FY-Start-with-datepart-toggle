# Tableau-Dynamic-FY-Start-with-datepart-toggle
 Overcomes the limitation of Tableau whereby custom FY start months cannot be used in calculated fields. Provides logic which solves the issues for all possible combinations of date and FY year start. Totally modular and can be used with any Date field.
