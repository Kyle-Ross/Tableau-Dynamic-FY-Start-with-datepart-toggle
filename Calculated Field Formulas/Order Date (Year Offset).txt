/*

Tableau uses a January starting fiscal year by default in calculated fields
it isn't possible to change this, so this can be an issue with analysis requiring
both a different fiscal year and the use of this in a calculated field

However, we can use this as a known variable to systematically
correct the year where needed to suit the any possible
fiscal year starting months, which we choose via the [FY Start Month Parameter]
